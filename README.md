# Basic Data Structures in C++

## Introduction

Hi, I will be updating this Git with some data structures using Modern C++.

Why C++? Because Modern C++ is awesome!

Data Structures at the moment:
* Singly Linked List (Features: Smart pointers for ownership, move semantics, fluent interface)
* Doubly Linked List (Features: Smart pointers for ownership, move semantics, fluent interface)
* Stack - List and Vector Based (Features: Fluent interface)
* Binary Search Tree (Features: Smart pointers for ownership, move semantics, fluent interface)

## Why
This is just for fun and for practicing Modern C++ :)

## Important
These data structures are currently in the C++ Standard Library, please use the standard library http://en.cppreference.com.
