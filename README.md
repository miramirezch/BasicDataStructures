# Basic Data Structures in C++

## Introduction

Hi, I will be updating this Git with some data structures using Modern C++.

Why C++? Because Modern C++ is awesome!

Data Structures at the moment:
* Singly Linked List (Modern C++ Features: Smart pointers for ownership and move semantics)
* Doubly Linked List (Modern C++ Features: Smart pointers for ownership and move semantics)

## Why
This is just for fun and for practicing Modern C++ :)

## Important
These data structures are currently in the C++ Standard Library, please use the standard library http://en.cppreference.com.
